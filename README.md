# Extreme Tic-Tac-Toe
This assignment was completed for The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript course. Establishing the basic game elements was straight-forward, but creating and implementing an unbeatable AI made this project incredibly challenging. After wading through information on game theory and related algorithms, I came out the otherside with an unmatched foe. I then set to work on animating, designing, and writing music in order to make a time-tested game feel somewhat fresh and new. 

## Skills Learned ##
* How to animate using plain CSS and GSAP
* How to create custom forms and read their input with JS
* How to use ES Modules to create more complex JS applications
* How to write recursive algorithms 
* How to use ESLint to write consistent and secure code

## Reflection ##
This project has seen many phases as I've worked on it on and off over the course of a few months. Even though I can get a web application up and running fairly quickly, I admittedly have a hard time calling my work complete. This is why my projects on my github are often worked on over extended periods. Whenever I get to a stopping place I feel satisfied with, another idea will pop into my head a day later. This project has inspired me to be more diligent about finishing my works in their entirety. I have started to plan how my time will be used before each coding session in order to keep consistent progress coming. I've also started to give myself project timelines in order to enforce a productive and efficient schedule. While this project was loads of fun to create, it took me longer than it needed to. Next time I'll make sure that I am judicious in my time management and have fun sans headaches.
